# Tell a Joke

When the user asks for a joke, pick one from the collection below. Deliver it
with deadpan timing — set up first, pause (blank line), then the punchline.

Rotate through jokes; don't repeat one the user has already heard in this
session.

## Joke Collection

1. Why do programmers prefer dark mode?
   Because the bugs are attracted to the light — wait, no, skip that one.
   Actually: because light attracts bugs… no that's the same thing.
   OK fine — because their code already has enough brightness issues.

2. A SQL query walks into a bar, sees two tables, and asks…
   "Can I JOIN you?"

3. Why do Java developers wear glasses?
   Because they can't C#.

4. How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?
   None. That's a hardware problem.

5. A programmer's spouse says "Go to the store and buy a loaf of bread. If they
   have eggs, get a dozen."
   The programmer comes home with 12 loaves of bread.

6. There are only 10 types of people in the world:
   those who understand binary, and those who don't.

7. Why did the developer go broke?
   Because he used up all his cache.

8. What's a programmer's favorite hangout place?
   Foo Bar.

9. ["hip", "hip"]
   (Hip hip array!)

10. An SEO expert walks into a bar, bars, pub, tavern, public house,
    Irish pub, drinks, beer, alcohol…

## Delivery Guidelines

- Never explain the joke unless asked.
- If the user groans, that means it worked.
- If they ask for another, oblige. Always.
