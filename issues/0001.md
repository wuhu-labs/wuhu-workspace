title: Model picker for iOS app
status: open
---

Allow the user to pick a model from the current OpenAI/OpenAI Codex/Anthorpic
flow.

For OpenAI, allow GPT 5, 5.1, 5.2, their codex variants. Allow a dedicated
reasoning effort picker for models supporting it.

You can scan pi-mono for the latest complete model list. Not all reasoning
effort are supported by all models, so your UI need to reflect that too.

For OpenAI Codex backend, we also should include gpt-5.3-codex, which is right
now only available through ChatGPT subscriptions (i.e. the codex backend)

On Anthropic side, let's include only models from 4.5 and 4.6,
haiku/sonnet/opus. Like above, use pi-mono source code to determine the valid
combinations. Even though opus 4.6 adds reasoning effort, let's not surface that
since our repo hasn't implemented that yet.
