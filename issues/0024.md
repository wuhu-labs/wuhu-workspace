title: "Address split SSE endpoint for non-app usage"
status: open

## Context

The server exposes two SSE endpoints for session observation:

1. `GET /v1/sessions/:id/subscribe` — Full subscription with initial state,
   multi-cursor gap-free reconnection, settings/status/queue events, designed
   to stay open indefinitely. Used by WuhuApp via `RemoteSessionSSETransport`.

2. `GET /v1/sessions/:id/follow` — Simplified single-turn stream that emits
   `entryAppended`, `assistantTextDelta`, `idle`, `done`. Has `stopAfterIdle`
   and `timeoutSeconds` params. Used by CLI (`wuhu`), integration tests, and
   `WuhuClient.promptStream`.

Now that MVPApp is migrating to the proper `/subscribe` path, `/follow` is only
used by CLI and tests for "watch one agent turn" workflows.

## Questions to resolve

- Should `/follow` remain as-is for CLI/scripting convenience, or should those
  consumers also move to `/subscribe`?
- If `/follow` stays, should it be documented as a convenience/scripting-only
  endpoint to prevent future apps from using it as primary observation?
- Could `/follow` be implemented as a thin wrapper over `/subscribe` internally
  to reduce duplication in `WuhuService`?
