# WUHU-0051: Trim tool surface

## Summary

Reduce the agent tool count from 21 to ~12 by removing tools that are
unprincipled, redundant, or better served by a future JS repl.

## Tools to remove

| Tool | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `swift` | Bizarre as an agent tool. Will be replaced by JS repl. |
| `fork` | Channel-specific, removed with channels (WUHU-0050). |
| `env_create` | Renamed and reduced — see below. |
| `env_update` | Full CRUD over tool calls is overkill. |
| `env_delete` | Full CRUD over tool calls is overkill. |

## Tools to rename

| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| `env_list` | `mount_template_list` (or defer to JS repl) |
| `env_get` | `mount_template_get` (or defer to JS repl) |

## Tools to keep as-is

| Tool | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `read` | Core filesystem |
| `write` | Core filesystem |
| `edit` | Core filesystem |
| `ls` | Core filesystem |
| `find` | Core filesystem |
| `grep` | Core filesystem |
| `bash` | Core execution |
| `async_bash` | Core execution |
| `async_bash_status` | Core execution |
| `create_session` | Multi-session orchestration |
| `join_sessions` | Multi-session orchestration |
| `list_child_sessions` | Multi-session orchestration |
| `read_session_final_message` | Multi-session orchestration |
| `session_steer` | Multi-session orchestration |
| `session_follow_up` | Multi-session orchestration |

## New tool

| Tool | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `mount` | Mount a directory mid-session (WUHU-0047) |

## Result

~16 tools. Further reduction to ~10-12 depends on the JS repl absorbing
session management tools (future work).
