title: Better tool call error message
status: open
---

Right now, we parse tool call JSON using Swift codable and surface the Swift
error. I want you to parse them into the [Any: Any] thing and then do a parse
manually -- we only have seven tools so this is very doable.

The main motivation is that, some model is post trained in a broken fashion, see
GitHub issue #12.

In the particular case of #12, we could have an error message like:

"read" tool expects number for key path "offset", but value "true" of boolean
received.

Add unit tests where you see fit.
