title: Retry LLM request in case of a failure
status: open
---

Retry each LLM request for up to five times, with exponential backoff.

- Each retry should be recorded as a separate entry to the client, both wuhu
  client CLI and the iOS app
- This entry should not be exposed to LLM context

After five times, we give up, and send the final give up message to the user.
Again, don't expose this to the user.
