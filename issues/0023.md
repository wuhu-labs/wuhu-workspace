title: "MVPApp: add refresh timer for sessions, channels, docs, and issues"
status: closed
priority: medium

## Context & Intent

The MVPApp loads all data once on `onAppear` and never refreshes. Sessions,
channels, docs, and issues all go stale until the app is restarted. The WuhuApp
has a `refreshTimerEffect` that periodically re-fetches sessions — the MVPApp
needs the same treatment across all data types.

## Tasks

- Add a periodic refresh timer (e.g. every 15-30s) that re-fetches sessions,
  channels, docs, and issues from the server.
- Ensure the refresh doesn't disrupt current UI state (selected session,
  scroll position, draft text).
- Consider a manual pull-to-refresh or refresh button as well.
- Channel messages should also update when the channel is selected (beyond
  just the post-send stream).
