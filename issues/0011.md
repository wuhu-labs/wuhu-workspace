Study pi-mono for their skills integration (pi-coding-agent)

We need to add some initial support for agents

1. Load skills automatically, from 
- the folder in ~/.wuhu/skills
- ./.wuhu/skills from environment root
2. In UI, apps and client CLI, support list skills for a particular session
3. Verify by asking the model if they can see available skills: available skills should be loaded into the LLM context
4. We do not support the slash command, /skill:xxx
