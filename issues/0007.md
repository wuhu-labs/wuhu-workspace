title: Remove the unnecessary assistant message truncation
status: closed
---

There seems to be an unwanted assistant message truncation in the iOS app --
streaming can show more messages, but when streaming is finished, the message is
capped. This is outright wrong and should be fixed. In all verbosity level,
assistant output should always be kept. Verbosity level only changes tool call
(call + result) presentation. Fix this.
