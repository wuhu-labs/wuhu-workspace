# WUHU-0040: Add session archiving

## Problem

As a user accumulates sessions, the session list becomes cluttered with old/finished
sessions that are no longer relevant. There's currently no way to hide them without
losing the data.

## Solution

Add the ability to archive (and unarchive) a coding session:

- **Data model**: Add an `isArchived` boolean column on `sessions` (default `false`).
- **Store / Service**: Add `archiveSession` and `unarchiveSession` methods.
- **API**: `POST /v1/sessions/:id/archive`, `POST /v1/sessions/:id/unarchive`.
- **Client**: Corresponding `WuhuClient` methods.
- **App UI**: Expose archive/unarchive in the session list context menu (iOS + macOS).
  By default, archived sessions are hidden from the list. Add a toggle to reveal them.

## Scope

- This is a soft-archive (not deletion). Archived sessions remain in the database
  and can be unarchived at any time.
- `listSessions` should accept an `includeArchived` query parameter (default `false`).
- Archiving a session does not stop it — it only hides it from the default list view.
