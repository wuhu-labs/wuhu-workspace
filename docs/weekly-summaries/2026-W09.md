## Sunday, March 1

Big architecture day: channels were dropped in favor of mounts, the monorepo
was officially archived, and a full Sparkle auto-update pipeline landed for the
macOS app (with many iterative fixes to get notarization + Gatekeeper + XPC
right).

### wuhu (monorepo)

- **Archive the monorepo:** Remove all code, point to successor repos (#100).

### wuhu-core

- **Load skills and AGENTS.md from workspace root** (#10) — context injection
  now reads from the workspace instead of requiring per-session config.
- **Add FileIO protocol** with swift-dependencies and migrate tool tests
  (#11) — filesystem abstraction for testability.
- **Mounts, context cleanup, drop channels, trim tools, DB migration** (#12)
  — major simplification: channels are gone, replaced by mount-based working
  directories. Unused tools trimmed, DB migrated to v6.
- **In-memory WuhuService test harness** with mock LLM (#13) — end-to-end
  test infrastructure that runs without a real server or model.
- **Fix v6 migration** to preserve sessions instead of dropping them (#14).
- **Fix context injection,** default model, and migration data repair (#15).
- **Lazy cwd, scratch mount, absolute path support, prompt fixes** (#16).
- **Add mountTemplateID to mount tool,** rename environment → mount template
  across agent tools (#17) — agents can now `mount({"mountTemplateID": "..."})`
  to instantiate a workspace from a template directly.

### wuhu-app

- **Add Sparkle auto-update for macOS + release pipeline** (#7) — integrated
  Sparkle, appcast publishing to R2, and a GitHub Actions release workflow
  triggered by version tags.
- **Iterative release fixes** (#8–#14) — vendored Sparkle → fetch at build
  time, rename app to "Wuhu", fix Gatekeeper resource-fork rejection, unlock
  CI keychain for codesigning, derive version from git tags, enable Sparkle
  Installer XPC Service for sandboxed updates.
- **Enable Sparkle Installer XPC Service** for sandboxed updates (#15).
- **Use semver tag format** `v{VERSION}-{BUILD}` (#16).
- **Adapt to wuhu-core mounts:** drop channels, simplify session creation
  (#17).

### wuhu-site

- **Update download page** with direct download link and auto-update info
  (#6).
- **Update download URL** to `Wuhu-latest.zip` (#7).
